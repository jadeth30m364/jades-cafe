        ah, well i suppose there isn't much to know about me... if i'm being honest here, i am quite a simple person who enjoys the simple pleasures in life. i enjoy the feeling of enjoying a hot cup of coffee on a cold, foggy afternoon--the sound of rain pitter pattering outside as i stay tucked inside the cozy warmth of my house, or perhaps a quiet, intimate cafe, with the company of loved ones and a good movie and music strumming gently in the background. because of my love for this setting, i decided to recreate a place where these feelings can be emulated in my personal website. you can think of this as a kind of online cafe of sorts, where you can slow down and enjoy a bit of peace in our busy, fast-moving online (and for that matter offline, as well) world. enjoy~!

        oh, you wanted to know more about me? well, alright, if you insist. when i'm not relaxing and taking a moment to appreciate the little things in life, i enjoy eating tasty foods and taking pictures of them. these pictures can all be found on my instagram account: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jadethewangster/">

        in addition to photography, i also feel strongly about gender equity, specifically, bridging the gender gap in stem because of my various tumultous experiences as a woman in stem myself. in order to tackle such a major issue, i work with organizations such as <a href="girlswhocode.com">girls who code</a> and <a href="superposition.tech">superposition. </a> in fact, i am in leadership positions at local branches of both of said organizations, as i am the president of american high school's girls who code club and one of the chapter leads of superposition fremont. by working with these said organizations, i create spaces where female identifying students can explore their passions in stem without any sexism or misogyny. i hope that in the future, such organizations will no longer be needed, as this problem will be fixed.
